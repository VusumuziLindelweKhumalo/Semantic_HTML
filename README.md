# Semantic HTML
---
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to convey the meaning of the content on a web page, rather than just its appearance. Semantic helps search engines and other technologies understand the structure and purpose of the content on your site. It makes your content more accessible to people who use assistive technologies to navigate the web and also it makes your code easier to read and maintain, since the purpose of each element is clear.
